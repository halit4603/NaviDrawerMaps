# Navigation Drawer with Maps Activity

ðŸ“± ðŸŽ§ Build a Navigation Drawer with a Maps Activity as the Main Activity

 Usage
 -----
This guide explains how to setup a basic material design style drawer filled with navigation items that switch different fragments into the content area. In this way, you can define multiple fragments, and then define the list of options which will display in the drawers items list. Each item when clicked will switch the relevant fragment into the activity's container view.

It also has a Map activity in ints main Layout
